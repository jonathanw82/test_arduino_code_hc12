Why am I metering the sound frequencies in the beehive?.  There is scientific data that correlates changes in sound frequency inside the beehive when the behaviour of the bees change, this data can be used to predict swarming or intent to swarm, the doc can be found here[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229224190_Monitoring_of_swarming_sounds_in_bee_hives_for_early_detection_of_the_swarming_period]. It also relates to where the hive is queenless.

Quote form the doc ( Swarming is indicated by an increase in the power spectral density at about 110 Hz; approaching to swarm the sound augmented in amplitude and frequency to 300 Hz, occasionally a rapid change occurred from 150 Hz to 500 Hz. Another finding indicating the initiation of a swarming period is the rise in temperature from 33 °C to 35 °C until the actual time of swarming when the temperature starts dropping to 32 °C. With more activity, ventilation from bee wings causes a drop of temperature.) with this I mind is the reason we are also collecting the internal hive temperature.
